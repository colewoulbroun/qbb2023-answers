Step 2 Written Response: When full intersection of two fragments from Sample 1 and Sample 2 were required for it to be read as an overlap, most peaks from both datasets were still integrated into the overlapping dataset.  For Sample 1, about 89.5% of the peaks were intersecting, while about 87.1% of Sample 2 peaks were intersecting.

Step 3 Written Response: The peaks between two samples are fairly reproducbile.  While the peaks are not entirely replicated between the two samples, a peak in one area of the sequence of interest will usually predict a peak in a largely overlapping area of the other sequence.  This lack of complete reproducibility can be mediated by the combined peaks bedgraph, which only shows the intersecting and, therefore, more probable and reproducible peaks.  Upon looking at the data, similar p-values in a section of the bedgraphs from each sample tend to predict an enriched region of consistent length across samples in this section of the bedgraph.  This suggests that the p-value range of a peak can indicate reproducibility.  By looking at the data, I can see that this trend is not observed perfectly across the 2 megabases that our experiment assessed, as some peaks with similar p-values will not have complete overlap.  This indicates that the trend is not completely consistent.
